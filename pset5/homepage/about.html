                <p>Copy and pasted bio for tutoring:</p>
                <p>I have always thoroughly enjoyed helping others to understand difficult concepts. When someone is struggling with a problem, it's extremely gratifying to be able to lead them to success. Many students struggle not due to lack of talent or effort, but rather they lack the personal guidance, alternate explanations, and expertise needed to frame these problems in a way that's easily understandable. As a tutor, I have the ability to influence my students in a positive and personal way which I am extremely grateful for.</p>
                <p>Copy and pasted personal info:</p>
                <p>I enjoy having a variety of hobbies which I can pick up when the urge hits. To stay healthy I lift weights, practice calisthenics, and go running through my neighborhood. I also practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu whenever I get the chance, which I love for the analytical and tactical aspects as well as the positive and supportive community. Having been a picky eater when I was young, I've taught myself to cook and am always happy to make food for my family and friends. To relax after stressful days I enjoy casually playing guitar, messing with scales and playing whatever songs fit my mood.</p>
